# pbibtex-manual

This is a project of preparing a manual of Japanese pBibTeX and upBibTeX.

## Contents

The main document (pbibtex-manual.pdf) is an official manual of
Japanese pBibTeX and upBibTeX.

Current (u)pBibTeX is a forked version of JBibTeX.  For historical
reasons, we provide the documentations of JBibTeX as-is:

    * jbibtex.pdf: Basic description of JBibTeX.
    * jbtxdoc.pdf: Japanese translation of btxdoc.pdf, with additional notes for JBibTeX.
    * jbtxhak.pdf: Japanese translation of btxhak.pdf, with additional notes for JBibTeX.

Note that descriptions of JBibTeX's encoding handling are
incorrect any more with (u)pBibTeX.
